# checkoff [WIP]
A Desktop Books Reader, Note Taker and Task Management App running on a Node Environment built with Electron, Photon, Jade and Jquery


---

## Intro
If you are like me, you have found yourself downloading 10, 20, maybe a 100 e-books on your computer with the hopes of reading them later.

Often times, we get carried away by our day to day activities that we forget to go back to most of these books and extract the possibly life changing piece of information they contain.

Sometimes, you start one book and along the way, you pick up another and totally lose track of where you were with the first.

Well, here is a tool to help you better manage your life/studies.
